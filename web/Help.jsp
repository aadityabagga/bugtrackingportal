    <b>Dear Consumer,</b><br>
            
            <br>
            Whenever you have a problem regarding our product, you can file a bug (complaint) about it by clicking on the <a href="PostNewBug.jsp">post bug</a> link
            in the menu.<br>
            
            After you have posted (filed) your bug, you can view it through the view bugs option in the menu.<br>
            Initially its status will be <b>'Pending'</b><br><br>
            
            When you post the bug, it is viewed by a monitor (an intermediary) of our organisation, who will view your bug and assign
            it to an expert.<br>
            
            Whenever the monitor assigns your bug to an expert, the status of your bug will change to <b>'Assigned'</b> to help you to know that
            your bug has been processed and is in the process of being solved.<br><br>
            
            When the expert solves your bug, the status of your bug will change to <b>'Solved'</b> and you will be able to view the solution.<br>
            <br>
            You can submit a <b>'Feedback'</b> about the solution if you are not able to understand it or are not satisfied with the solution,
            by clicking on the submit feedback option after the bug.<br>
            The expert will then try to assist you.<br>
            If you are not satisfied then we will reassign your bug to a different expert to help solve your problem.<br>
            <br>
